## Temporary Placeholder Options

### Option 1: Use Stock Images

- Pexels (pexels.com)
- Pixabay (pixabay.com)

Search terms:

- "indie band"
- "rock concert"
- "musician portrait"
- "music festival"
- "dark moody portrait"

### Option 2: Use Placeholder Services

- https://via.placeholder.com/1200x800/1e2749/818cf8?text=Album+Cover

### Option 3: Create Simple Graphics

Use Canva (canva.com) to create:

- Album cover designs
- Band member placeholder cards
- Promotional graphics

## How to Add Images

1. Download or create your images
2. Save them in the `images/` folder with the exact filenames listed above
3. The HTML already references these filenames, so no code changes needed
4. Test the site to ensure images load properly

## Current Status

✅ All HTML structure complete  
✅ All image src attributes in place  
❌ Actual image files need to be added  
✅ Fallback styling ensures site looks good even without images

## Notes

- The site is fully functional without images (uses emoji and placeholder backgrounds)
- Images enhance the visual appeal but aren't required for functionality
- You can add images incrementally as you find/create them
- Consider band's brand identity when selecting/creating images
