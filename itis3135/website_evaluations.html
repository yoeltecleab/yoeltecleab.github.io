    <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
    <section>
        <h3><a href="https://arngren.net/" target="_blank">arngren.net</a></h3>
        <p>Arngren is an infamous example of poor web design, featuring a chaotic layout, excessive use of colors,
            and a lack of visual hierarchy. The site attempts to sell a wide variety of products but overwhelms visitors
            with clutter and confusion.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The site uses many clashing colors and backgrounds, making it hard to focus
                on any one area. There is little effective contrast to guide the eye.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> There is no consistent style or repeated elements; every section looks
                different, which adds to the confusion.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Items are scattered all over the page with no clear alignment. Text and
                images are placed haphazardly, making the site look messy and unprofessional.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related items are not grouped together. Products, prices, and descriptions
                are all jumbled, making it difficult to understand what belongs together.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3><a href="https://jetbrains.com/" target="_blank">jetbrains.com</a></h3>
        <p>jetbrains.com is a well-designed site for a software company, offering a clean, modern interface with clear
            navigation and strong visual hierarchy. The site effectively communicates its products and services to
            visitors.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The site uses color and whitespace effectively to highlight important
                elements and create a clear visual hierarchy.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Consistent use of fonts, colors, and button styles throughout the site
                reinforces branding and usability.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> All elements are neatly aligned, creating a professional and organized
                appearance that is easy to scan.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related content is grouped together logically, making it easy for users to
                find information and understand relationships between elements.
            </li>
        </ul>
